# About

As advocates of open-source software (OSS), we support
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/sustaining_members.html), the
[Julia programming language](https://github.com/sponsors/julialang), the
[R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) and the
[FreeBSD Foundation](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/).

We devote about 20% of our time to OSS, maintaining
[dev containers](https://containers.dev), docker images and deployment templates
for Data Scientists.

Our credo: Self-host your Data Science software stack: Use
[Tr√¶fik](https://github.com/b-data/docker-deployment-traefik),
[GitLab](https://github.com/b-data/docker-deployment-gitlab-ce) and
[Jupyter](https://github.com/b-data/docker-deployment-jupyter)
([JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) +
[code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)).

Here, you can find everything you need!
